# memory-game-demo
This is a simple but engaging Memory Game application built using C# and WPF, developed as part of my Advanced Programming Methods course at Universitatea Transilvania Brasov. This project showcases clean architecture practices, with a strong emphasis on the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern.

🔧 Features
- A login screen where the user can enter a name and associate a profile picture to their account
- JSON functionality for saving player data (name, profile picture, statistics: games played, games won)
- Multiple image categories to enhance replayability
- A simple memory game where you have to match all the cards with the same image in a time limit to win
- Different difficulties / game modes (standard - 4x4, 3x4, 4x5)
  
🎯 Educational Focus : This project was designed to demonstrate control over the basics of WPF application structure, XAML-based UI development, and MVVM practices. It served as an opportunity to deepen my understanding of:
- ViewModel-driven UI updates
- Property change notification via INotifyPropertyChanged
- Command binding for UI interactions (ICommand)
- Decoupling of logic from the view for testability and flexibility
  
📁 Technologies Used
- C# (.NET)
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- MVVM architecture
- XAML

🍏 What I Learned
- To structure an application in C# and WPF
- To design an user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing UI
- To implement MVVM and more readily use it in future projects

💡 What To Expect In The Future : Just because I've turned in this project does not mean I'm finished working on it! I believe any project can be perfected through hard work and perseverance and wish to further improve my game by adding:
  - a pause button
  - sound effects
  - different timer settings for each game mode
  - new game modes (4x6, 5x6, 6x6)
