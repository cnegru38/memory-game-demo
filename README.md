# memory-game-demo
This is a simple but engaging Memory Game application built using C# and WPF, developed as part of my Advanced Programming Methods course at Universitatea Transilvania Brasov. This project showcases clean architecture practices, with a strong emphasis on the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern.
